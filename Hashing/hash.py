# Hashing comes as an very important Data Structure when we talk about search , insert and delete operations. 
# for a unsorted data Hashing takes O(n) for search O(1) for insert and delete operations. 

# When to not use hashing is :
# Find closest value , When data is sorted , prefix searching . For Prefiz searching we can rather use Trie Data Structure and for closest value we can use AVL Trees.
